# Qtrip_Static
QTrip is a travel website aimed at travellers looking for a multitude of adventures in different cities. 
• Created 3 different web pages from Wireframe layout using HTML and CSS. 
• Utilized Bootstrap extensively for responsive design. 
• Deployed the website to Netlify.

**In this project I have used `HTML/CSS`, `GRID`, `FLEXBOX`, `BOOTSTRAP`, `MEDIA QUERRY` for mobile `responsiveness`**

**I have deployed this repo on `NETLIFY`**
